Djig
====

Djig is a minimalize Digg-like news aggregator for Django.  Designed to be 
fairly pluggable, but requires tastypie if you want to use the API functions, 
and Userena for profile modules.  

Future versions will be less dependant, but that's how it is for now.

Alpha code at the moment, not to be used.
