Djig
====

Djig is a minimalist, Digg-like news aggregator (old Digg, not new) for letting
users submit content.  Currently in a fairly alphaish state, not recommended
for use. 

Djig includes a search_indexes.py file and a couple of example search templates 
for use with Django-Haystack.  Haystack is not a requirement, and lack of its
presence should not cause any harm, but may be used if search is needed. You 
will need to at least update_index after installing Djig.
